Use Google maps to track cell phones from your WordPress website in real time.

== Description ==

GPS Plotter was forked from GPS Tracker by Nick Fox. Nick stopped development on GPS Tracker so we picked up where he left off. This WordPress plugin allows you to track Android cell phones in real time. You can watch the cell phones being tracked using Google maps and you can store and reload routes easily for later viewing. The plugin is fully responsive and this means that it will display properly on any device such as a cell phone, tablet or desktop computer.

View a working sample of the plugin here:

<a href="https://dvinnovationz.com/plotter_test/wordpress">GPS Plotter Sample</a>

You can download the app from the Android store then you enter your username and the sample URL above. Now you are ready to click "Tracking On" to start sending GPS tracking information to that URL.

Then you can go to that site on either your computer or mobile device and check out the GPS information your sending for yourself.

I hope you find this plugin useful, If you find any bugs, please email us so we can address any issues that come up immediately.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from the WP repository and then Activate.
2. Use our link to get your free Google API key
3. Enter your Free Google API key.
4. Add the short-code to any page or post: [gps_plotter]
5. Download Gps Plotter from the Google Play Store onto your Android cell phone and add your user name and the URL of the page you entered the short code to.

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.websmithing.wp.gpstracker_cs&hl=en">GPS Plotter Android App</a>

That's it! Click on the "Start Tracking" button and then go to your WordPress website and view your location on the map. Please note that it may take a couple of minutes for the first location to appear. If you are having trouble viewing your first location make sure you are outside and that there are not a lot of trees or something else covering your view of the sky. If it's a really cloudy day, it may take a while to get your first location. This is normal behavior for all cell phones since they tend to have a smaller antenna than a dedicated gps device.

Here are some known issues with GPS Plotter:

1. Make sure that there is a clear view to the sky.
   a. GPS cell phones do not work well inside buildings.
      (Go outside to get your initial signal)
   b. GPS cell phones do not work well with heavy tree covering. 
      (Try to get to a open area if you can)
   c. GPS cell phones do not work well around a lot of tall buildings. 
      (Get to the highest part of the building and get very close to a window)  
2. The mobile app only sends a GPS signal if the app user has moved more than 20 feet.

3. Make sure that the WordPress website page or post that you added the short-code to is visible to the public.

4. Make sure that you added the URL in the mobile app exactly as you see it.

5. Make sure there are no spaces in the UserName that you have added to the mobile app.
